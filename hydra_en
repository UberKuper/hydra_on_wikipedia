'''Hydra''' is a [[decentralization|decentralized]] [[cryptocurrency]] [[token (cryptocurrency)|token]] created on May 5, 2023<ref name="fortune_launch"/> on '''[[The Open Network|The Open Network (TON)]]''' [[blockchain]]. The project positions itself as a token with a mechanism for [[seigniorage|issuing]] new coins by providing [[liquidity (economics)|liquidity]] in pairs with the main $HYDRA token and other [[Jetton (TON blockchain)|Jettons]] on the TON blockchain.

== Concept and Mechanism ==
$HYDRA is positioned as a token utilizing a mechanism termed by the team as "Proof of Liquidity" (PoL)<ref name="TONCultureKings">{{Cite web |url=https://blog.ton.org/ton-culture-kings-hydra |title=TON Culture Kings: Hydra |website=TON Blog |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>. Unlike [[Proof-of-Work (PoW)]] and [[Proof-of-Stake (PoS)]], PoL, according to its developers, allows users to earn by providing liquidity to pools on [[decentralized exchange|decentralized exchanges (DEXs)]]<ref name="TONCultureKings" />.

==== Hydra Liquidity Pools ====
There are over 60 rewarded pools with the '''$HYDRA''' coin on [[decentralized exchange|DEXs]] such as DeDust.io<ref name="dedust_hydra_pools">{{Cite web |url=https://dedust.io/pools?prioritizePromoted=false&page=1&sort=tvl_DESC&assets=EQD4P32U10snNoIavoq6cYPTQR82ewAjO20epigrWRAup54_ |title=Hydra Liquidity Pools on DeDust |website=dedust.io |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref> and Ston.fi<ref name="stonfi_listing_ref">{{Cite web |url=https://app.ston.fi/pools/EQAE3jqovQueivQFoIMuEOVlDY7oERwWt9xxF9LAExAD57ur |title=HYDRA/TON Pool on Ston.fi |website=Ston.fi |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>. These pools link the $HYDRA token with various other tokens on the TON blockchain<ref name="TONCultureKings" /><ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics">{{Cite web |url=https://tonhydra.com |title=Hydra Coin Official Website |website=tonhydra.com |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>. This pool structure allows holders of other tokens to provide liquidity in pairs with HYDRA without selling their primary assets. According to the project, this helps maintain liquidity for participating tokens and Hydra itself<ref name="source2_pools_diversification">{{Cite web |url=https://tonresear.ch/t/hydra-coin-the-real-decentralization/3779 |title=Hydra Coin - The real decentralization? |website=TON Research Forum |access-date=2025-05-18 |quote=This diversification of pools creates an easy start for holders of other coins.}}</ref>. The DeDust.io DEX automatically reinvests swap fees back into the liquidity pool, increasing the providers' share<ref name="TONCultureKings"/>. Additionally, through DeDust.io's "routing" mechanism, arbitrage bots can facilitate the redistribution (balancing) of liquidity among all Hydra pools<ref name="TONCultureKings"/>.

'''Farming within PoL''' is a process where participants provide liquidity to pools and receive rewards in '''$HYDRA''' coins. Additionally, they earn commissions from [[swap (finance)|swaps]] (token exchanges) and, in some cases, additional '''$HYDRA''' rewards from the protocol<ref name="TONCultureKings" />. This is similar to [[staking (cryptocurrency)|staking]] in PoS but is focused on supporting trading liquidity. Farming, according to the project, offers flexibility: participants can use [[LP token|LP tokens]] (liquidity provider tokens) in other DeFi protocols while continuing to support liquidity<ref name="source6_pol_easy">{{Cite web |url=https://dyor.io/blog/hydra-token/ |title=HYDRA Token on the TON Blockchain: The History and Plans |website=DYOR.io |date=2025-02-28 |access-date=2025-05-18 |quote=TON HYDRA uses a new system called Proof of Liquidity (PoL), which makes it easier for people to earn rewards without needing a lot of money for staking, validation, or mining.}}</ref>. It is claimed that this approach minimizes the capital investment typical of mining or traditional staking, making farming accessible to a wider audience<ref name="source6_pol_easy"/>.

== Tokenomics ==
The total [[money supply|supply]] of '''HYDRA''' tokens is '''10,000,000''' coins<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_supply"/>.

*   '''Locked Funds:''' '''8,470,000 $HYDRA''' (84.7% of the total supply) are locked in a smart contract<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_lock"/> (e.g., via the TonRaffles service) under a [[vesting]] mechanism. These funds are intended for gradual distribution as rewards in liquidity pools over many years.

*   '''Funds for Pool Rewards:''' Approximately '''1,434,000 $HYDRA''' (~14.34% of the total supply) are distributed or designated for distribution through smart contracts for liquidity pool rewards on [[decentralized exchange|DEXs]] like DeDust.io<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_rewards"/>.

*   '''Initial Liquidity:''' Approximately '''66,000 $HYDRA''' (~0.66% of the total supply) were allocated to create initial liquidity on decentralized exchanges. The resulting LP tokens were burned, making this liquidity permanently locked<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_lp_burn">{{Cite web |url=https://tonhydra.com |title=Hydra Coin Official Website — Tokenomics |website=tonhydra.com |access-date=2025-05-18 |quote=Primary circulation 0.66% of primary liquidity coins (LP tokens were burned)}}</ref>. It is stated that rewards generated by this share of liquidity are also subject to burning, which may reduce the total circulating supply<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_first_liquidity">{{Cite web |url=https://dedust.io/portfolio/EQBJrNx8lP9BGN-QkTVv5nJLQZxoO8YqnoXrr_DmUGuGugkX |title=Initial Locked Liquidity |website=dedust.io |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>.

== Achievements and Recognition ==
'''Number of Holders:''' As of May 2025, the number of unique addresses holding the HYDRA token was approximately 33,500<ref name="hydra_holders">{{Cite web |url=https://tonviewer.com/EQD4P32U10snNoIavoq6cYPTQR82ewAjO20epigrWRAup54_?section=holders |title=HYDRA Token — Holders on TON Viewer |website=tonviewer.com |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>.

'''Listings and Verifications:''' The token has been listed or verified on platforms such as DeDust.io, Ston.fi<ref name="stonfi_listing_ref"/>, Tonco.io<ref name="tonco_listing_ref">{{Cite web |url=https://app.tonco.io/#/pool/EQBQxcY1FVDlG03gPK_GmzSmt1XlJsbKWvTiwjZaTseAWQLF |title=HYDRA on Tonco.io |website=Tonco.io |access-date=2025-05-18}}</ref>, @xRocket (Telegram bot), CoinGecko, Dyor.io, GeckoTerminal, Tonviewer, Tonex, and CoinMarketCap<ref name="tonhydra_tokenomics_supply"/><ref name="TONCultureKings"/>.

'''Market Capitalization and TVL:''' In an interview for the TON Blog (published after The Open League Season 4 in 2024), the team stated that the project had reached a [[market capitalization|market capitalization]] of '''$160,000,000''' and a total [[Total value locked|TVL (Total Value Locked)]] of '''$3,000,000'''<ref name="TONCultureKings"/>.
